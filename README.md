# Midterm Project
The workflow for this project was as such:

First, I created basic templates for this page (not shown as there were problems with my initial repository). 

Then, using the provided link for creating a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp">navigation bar</a>, I responsively styled the navigation bar using the navbar.css stylesheet. 

I then added content to each page (Homepage/About Me, Project History, and Contact Me), and styled them while creating. All styles for the pages are in page.css.

For the Homepage, I used a href tags to create a Resume link, using the _blank target to make it open to a new page.

For the Projects tab, I used <a href=https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/>this flexbox guide</a> to help make each image centered, and experimentation with width, height, max-width and max-height to make the images scale.

Finally, using the same techniques as above, I styled the Contact Me page accordingly.
  
Finally, I added what I felt was an appropriate banner image which is the same across pages, with a centered title, and deployed the application on GitHub pages.
