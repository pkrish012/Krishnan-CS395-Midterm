                <li>o	Introductory Projects to Java Spring Boot and React JS</li>
                <li>o	Added outstanding features to an Assessment Application that is used internally, such as fleshing out the RBAC for the application by separating admin and user views, and creating a new page through which users could create a new client. 
                    I also worked on cleaning up the UI elements of the front page, in order to help the user more easily identify which page they are on.</li>

                <li>o	Project using Python, Snowflake SQL, Airflow, and Amazon Web Services</li>
                <li>o	Used Snowflake SQL and Python to pipe data in from a movie reviews database on Amazon S3, then classified the data on whether it was a positive or negative review using a python ML script on the EMR. 
                    Then, the classified data was sent back to the S3 bucket. 
                    From there, a view was created that held a summary of the data, and Tableau was subsequently used to show different attributes of that data.</li>
